        Liverpool FC took over Anfield, its home stadium, in 1892 after Everton was evicted from the ground earlier that year. The team won its first ever League Championship in 1901 after a run of nine wins and three draws from its last 12 encounters. The Reds had their best run in the 1970s and ‘80s, taking home 11 league titles and seven European trophies under the stewardship of Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. In 2001, the club won three titles in one season: the FA, UEFA and League Cups. It won its fifth European Cup in 2005.
Real Madrid has won the Champion League 10 times. Chelsea has won the trophy once, Manchester United thrice, Barcelona four times, Bayern Munich five times and AC Milan seven times. Arsenal has never won the cup.</p>

       <h2> History of Livepool FC </h2>  
        
        
        <p> 
        
        The club were founded in 1892 following a split from Everton F.C. and joined the Football League in 1893. The appointment of Tom Watson as manager resulted in the club's first successful period, in which they won two League Championships. Two League Championships were won in the 1920s and a further one was won in 1947. Following the club's fortunes declined and they were relegated to the Second Division in 1954. Bill Shankly was appointed as manager in 1959 and guided the club back into the First Division. Shankly's arrival laid the foundations for the club's success in the 1970s and 80s domestically and in European competition, as the club won numerous League Championships and four European Cups.

            Following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, English clubs were banned from European competitions until 1991. The club was still successful domestically winning three League Championships during this period. The 1990s saw a lack of success for the club as they struggled to repeat their success in the Premier League era. The club reached former heights in 2005 when they won the UEFA Champions League (formerly known as the European Cup) for a fifth time.

        <h2> Liver pool theme song and history</h2>

        <h4>
        When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high <br></br>
And don’t be afraid of the dark <br></br>
At the end of the storm, there’s a golden sky<br></br>
And the sweet, silver song of a lark<br></br>

Walk on through the wind<br></br>
Walk on through the rain<br></br>
Though your dreams be tossed and blown<br></br>

Walk on, walk on<br></br>
With hope in your heart<br></br>
And you’ll never walk alone<br></br>
You’ll never walk alone<br></br>

Walk on, walk on<br></br>
With hope in your heart<br></br>
And you’ll never walk alone<br></br>
You’ll never walk alone<br></br>
        </h4>
